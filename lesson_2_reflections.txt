What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
*Initializing a repository will copy the .git file into that directory making that an official Git one allowing
the content inside to be sync'ed with/to Git. The file contains configuration data. If it wasn't so then it wouldn't
 be able to sync.
