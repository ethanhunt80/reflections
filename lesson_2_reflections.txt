What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
*Initializing a repository will copy the .git file into that directory making that an official Git one allowing
the content inside to be sync'ed with/to Git. The file contains configuration data. If it wasn't so then it wouldn't
 be able to sync.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
*The staging area is an intermediate 'place' between your working directory and the git repository in the cloud and can only exist
after a local directory has been git initiated. Holds all the changes that you haven't committed yet and can be reversed before you do that.
