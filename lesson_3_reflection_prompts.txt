When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

As I see almost always when you need to have things stored in a trustworthy manner, somewhere you can trust you won't lose all the changes/creation you made.
Also when you want to share the work you've done with your peers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- 'Forkses' happen only in the GitHub context, it's like a clone but in GitHub's own infrastructure in the cloud.
- Clones are the local repository copies that we can make from repositories that are in the cloud (in this case GitHub
specifically)
- Branches are what the name say, branches (or changes) from the root that we can make without affecting it.
It's good for experimentation without the fear of breaking the main functionality.

I'd use a Fork to only copy the project that I want to, but I'm not sure I'd continue to make changes to the code
in the cloud environment as it may not be very productive, but I can change my mind about that if I notice there were
no major differences (which I doubt).
Clones are good to have the code you just forked into your local machine so that you can manipulate it freely and
make your own changes/experimentation using branches for example.
