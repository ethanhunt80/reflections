When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

As I see almost always when you need to have things stored in a trustworthy manner, somewhere you can trust you won't lose all the changes/creation you made.
Also when you want to share the work you've done with your peers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic pulls could overwrite my local repository and I might lose changes that are valuable to me and that I don't wish to have either pushed or pulled (deleted in this case).
